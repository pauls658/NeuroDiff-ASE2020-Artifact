1. Recompile OpenBLAS and re-install it
	cd ~/OpenBLAS-0.3.6/
	make clean
	make
	sudo make install

2. A note about running delta_network_test
There is only one additional command line flag compared to the ReluDiff version. Otherwise everything else is the same. The new option is -e, and it is for specifying the number of intermediate variables to use in the forward pass. You should specify -e 0. This tells the script to use the heuristic for choosing the number extra vars as described in section 4.4 of the paper

3. Running ACAS experiments
This script has examples of how to compile NeuroDiff for the ACAS experiments: script/run_all_exps.sh (it's called run_all_exps.sh, but it actually only does ACAS).
There are several blocks of commands in the script, which each have a comment describing what they do. These correspond to the different "configurations" of NeuroDiff -- you can compile it w/o intermediate symbolic vars, and w/o linear relaxtion. The block at the end compiles the "full" NeuroDiff.
Note that there are two different types of linear relaxation -- one that is performed on the "absolute" intervals of the neurons, and our novel linear relaxation for the delta interval.

4. Running MNIST global perturbation exps
script/run_all_mnist_global_exps.sh will run the experiments for the largest net (4x1024) for perturbation strengths 3 to 7. Currently, this script won't actually perform any refinement, it will simply run a forward pass, check if the property is verified, and quit. This is because usually refinement did not make a difference for these properties, so we sped up the experimentation in this way.
