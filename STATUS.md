[Reusable]

- Reasons
	- We release the full source code of everything that is necessary to re-produce every result of the paper. This includes the source code for ReluDiff, and the code we used to evaluate ReluVal and DeepPoly.
	- We release all of the neural networks used in our experiments, namely the ACAS Xu, MNIST, and HAR networks. We also release the tools we developed to produce the truncated networks, and the subtracted networks as described in the paper.
	- We release both a VM with ReluDiff, ReluVal, and DeepPoly all working out-of-the-box, and also instructions on how to set them up from scratch on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 install
	- We provide scripts that demonstrate that how to execute ReluDiff, ReluVal, and DeepPoly. These scripts re-run some of the shorter-running experiments described in the paper.
	- We also release the full scripts used to run all of the experiments if anyone would like to reproduce all of our results.
	- Everything described above (except the VM) is available in the repositiory: https://github.com/pauls658/ReluDiff-ICSE2020-Artifact
